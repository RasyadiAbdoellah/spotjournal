# SpotJournal Frontend

Backend repo: https://github.com/RasyadiAbdoellah/spotscout-api

SpotJournal is a simple full stack app that allows users to save a list of locations with notes attached to each place.

I had a lists of general areas in Manhattan that I want to revisit. I lost that list. I want to make a digital list that's capable of showing me the location on a map, possibly with pictures and descriptors to why its interesting, so that I don't lose it again.

The frontend is a dynamic single page application built with Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Handlebars. Interaction with the backend is handled completely through jQuery Ajax. Retrieved data is displayed through the Handlebars templating engine. Functionality and styling is achieved through a mix of Bootstrap and jQuery.
